# [Appocalypse:THE APP] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Garbage_Collectors]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Shahrukh Dawood] - [Albertian institute of science and technology]
- Member 2: [Ameena Sulfikar] - [Albertian institute of science and technology]

### Project Description
[A parody productivity suite gone rogue ‚Äî Appocalypse bundles bizarre, hilarious, and mildly terrifying apps into one fullscreen launcher. Each app is designed to confuse, distract, or mildly torment the user, all under the guise of being helpful. It‚Äôs the end of productivity as you know it.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Tired of being too productive?
Appocalypse solves the non-existent crisis of getting things done on time by flooding your screen with chaos, confusion, and cartoonish distractions.
Finally, an app suite that guarantees you'll accomplish absolutely nothing ‚Äî in style.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Appocalypse tackles the imaginary epidemic of over-productivity by flooding your screen with chaos, confusion, and cartoonish distractions.
It replaces your focus with fake weather, RAM-hungry monsters, and a maze that mocks you.
Finally, an app that ensures you‚Äôll never accidentally get anything done again.]
